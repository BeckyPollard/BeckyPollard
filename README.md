### Who is she?
I've been a web developer by trade since 2018, with a passion for front end programming. I love action/fantasy role-playing games, am an enthusiast about many topics of thanatology, an advocate for the benefits of a good night's sleep, the owner of a [black cat](http://becky.dev/assets/images/creature.jpg), and a friend with a flair for making tech feel human.

### What does she do?
